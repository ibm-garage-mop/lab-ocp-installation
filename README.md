# Install an Openshift cluster with Terraform and PowerVC

During this demonstration you will move from having a PowerVC up and running to an openshift cluster up and running in less than 90 minutes. 
you will be performing the scripted installation that will : 
 - Create Linux on Power Virtual machines
 - Perform the openshift deployment ( 3 masters + 3 workers )
 - Connect to the openshift console 

As a take away you will get the git repository to perform the same exercise at home. 
I hope you will enjoy !
